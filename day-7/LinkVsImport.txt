Link works parallely but it can also work in background using prefetch attribute.

import works in series but import works in background

link is always better than import for browser but as developer we use import because
import makes debugging easy

However, many link tag in html makes website slow becuase each link tag will make separate request thus 
while deploying weâ€™ll merge all css file in a single file using some tool eg. webpack, vite for 
bundling and then deploy it.


extras----

<link> Works in Parallel:
When you use the <link> tag to include a stylesheet, the browser fetches the stylesheet independently 
and concurrently with other resources (e.g., images, scripts, other stylesheets).
This parallel behavior ensures faster loading because multiple resources are being downloaded 
simultaneously.

@import Works in Series:
When you use the @import rule inside a CSS file, the browser fetches the imported stylesheet only after
it has finished downloading and parsing the parent stylesheet.
This sequential behavior delays the loading process because each imported file has to wait for the 
previous one to be fetched and processed.
